title: Rails View Playground
---

Howdy! This is the Rails View Playground, a place for kids, pancakes, and soon, waffles.

What makes this so special? Well for starters this is a markdown file that you can edit on-the-fly.

That means you can take a chunk of markdown like this:

```md
![Pancake video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPl7D20F2mE)
```

and make it emit the HTML you'd expect for a video.
